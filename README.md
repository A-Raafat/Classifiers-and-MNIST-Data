# Classifiers-and-MNIST-Data
Extracting features using PCA, DCT, Centroid features and Auto encoder of 1 hidden-layer then classifying the data using K-means (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 clusters for each cluster), GMM(1, 2), SVM (linear and non linear)

Finally we compare all classifiers and their accuracy in a table
